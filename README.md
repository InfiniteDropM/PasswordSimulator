+Haudio Designs  ~ Inspiration and original idea
Tutorial(s) ~ Not any specific, but took aspects from several

This was just an experimentation, but be sure to tell me what you think and how I can improve upon the 'project' :)
Also, GitHub repository is soon to be created, so you can look at the code and learn for yourself!

Note: Text-to-Dot script is quite glitchy, as I am still learning ActionScript 3, so keep that in mind :)
